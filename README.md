# Audio Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning (CNN)
## Overview
This project implements an audio sentiment analysis system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system processes audio input files, extracts features using librosa, and predicts the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) expressed in the speech/audio. The backend is built with Flask to provide a simple web interface for uploading audio files and displaying sentiment predictions.
